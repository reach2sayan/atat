"->What does this program do?\n"
"\n"
"1) It reads the lattice file (specified by the -l option). (See format below.)\n"
"\n"
"2) It determines the space group of this lattice and\n"
"   writes it to the sym.out file.\n"
"\n"
"3) It finds all symmetrically distinct clusters-'object' pairs that satisfy the\n"
"   conditions specified by the options -2 through -6.\n"
"   For instance, if -2=2.1 -3=1.1 is specified,\n"
"   only pair clusters shorter than 2.1 units and triplet clusters containing\n"
"   no pairs longer than 1.1 will be selected.\n"
"   This produces a generalized cluster expansion (GCE) representating a relationship\n"
"   between a property of type 'object' and a crystal structure.\n"
"   The 'object' can be anything obeying well-defined symmetry rules.\n"
"   By default the 'object' is a tensor of rank defined in the file gcetensor.in (see below for format).\n"
"\n"
"4) It writes all clusters found to clusters.out.\n"
"   If the -c option is specified, clusters are read from clusters.out instead.\n"
"\n"
"5) It reads the structure file (specified by the -s option).\n"
"\n"
"6) It determines, for that structure, the correlations associated with all\n"
"   the clusters chosen earlier.\n"
"   This information is then output on one line, in the same order as in the\n"
"   clusters.out file. See below for conventions used to calculate correlations.\n"
"\n"
"7) It writes the files corrdump.log containting the list of all adjustements\n"
"   needed to map the (possibly relaxed) structure onto the ideal lattice.\n"

"Lattice and structure files\n"
"\n"
"Both the lattice and the structure files have a similar structure.\n"
"First, the coordinate system a,b,c is specified, either as\n"
"[a] [b] [c] [alpha] [beta] [gamma]\n"
"or as:\n"
"[ax] [ay] [az]\n"
"[bx] [by] [bz]\n"
"[cx] [cy] [cz]\n"
"Then the lattice vectors u,v,w are listed, expressed in the coordinate system\n"
"just defined:\n"
"[ua] [ub] [uc]\n"
"[va] [vb] [vc]\n"
"[wa] [wb] [wc]\n"
"Finally, atom positions and types are given, expressed in the same coordinate system\n"
"as the lattice vectors:\n"
"[atom1a] [atom1b] [atom1c] [atom1type]\n"
"[atom2a] [atom2b] [atom2c] [atom1type]\n"
"etc.\n"
"\n"
"In the lattice file:\n"
"-The atom type is a comma-separated list of the atomic\n"
" symbols of the atoms that can sit the lattice site.\n"
"-The first symbol listed is assigned a spin of -1.\n"
"-When only one symbol is listed, this site is ignored for the purpose\n"
" of calculating correlations, but not for determining symmetry.\n"
"-The atomic symbol 'Vac' is used to indicate a vacancy.\n"
"\n"
"In the structure file:\n"
"-The atom type is just a single atomic symbol\n"
" (which, of course, has to be among the atomic symbols given in the\n"
" lattice file).\n"
"-Vacancies do not need to be specified.\n"

"There is no limit on how far an atom in a structure can be from\n"
